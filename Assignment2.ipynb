    "Eliezer's solution works great because the `insertLevelOrder` function ensures the binary tree is constructed accurately from the list, following level order. This means the tree structure reflects the input list's structure, assuming the list represents a complete binary tree. In the next step, the `find_paths` function traverses the tree using depth-first search (DFS). Exploring all branches (left and right subtrees) and backtracking after reaching leaf nodes guarantees that all root-to-leaf paths are found and recorded. In the end, Eliezer uses `backtracking` to add and then remove nodes from the current path. This part ensures that the `current_path` list accurately represents the path from the root to the current node at any point in the recursion. This way, when a leaf node is reached, `current_path` contains the path from the root to that leaf."

Also, it iterates through the list once to create all nodes and set their left and right children. Then, because of using the `Depth-First Search (DFS)` traversal of the tree, in the worst case, it visits each node exactly once, which gives a time complexity of `O(n)`.\n",
    "Eliezer's solution has a space complexity of `O(n)` because, based on the recursive DFS to find all paths, the maximum depth of the recursion call stack can be equal to the height of the tree, which, in the worst case, can be `O(n)`."

    "I found Eliezer's solution optimized for tree construction and finding paths. The tree construction method in this solution is straightforward and correctly builds the binary tree from a given array. The algorithm for finding root-to-leaf paths is efficient because it visits each node exactly once, but it could be considered slightly inefficient in terms of space because it creates a new list for every path found. \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential adjustments for Eliezer's solution can be:\n",
    "Instead of appending the current path to a list of paths at each leaf node, an alternative approach could involve using a global list to store paths and a temporary list to store the current path. This approach would still require copying the current path list when a leaf is reached, but it's a minor optimization that clarifies the intention of storing completed paths separately.\n",
    "While Eliezer's recursive method for constructing the tree is intelligent and straightforward, an iterative queue approach could be more intuitive and align more closely with the level-order traversal concept. \n",
    "The recursive depth-first search approach for finding paths is optimal in terms of ensuring that all paths are explored. However, the recursion could lead to a large call stack in extremely deep trees. An iterative stack approach could be considered, though it would complicate the logic for managing the current path state.\n",

    "Undertaking Assignment 1 was a significant leap in my journey of understanding complex problem-solving techniques. This project involved identifying missing numbers in a given range. The first step was to analyze the problem statement in detail. I spent time understanding the solution to the task, which involved identifying missing elements in a specified range of integers. To solve this problem, I revisited fundamental concepts in the lectures and Python, such as list manipulation, loops, and conditional statements, through various online resources and documentation.\n",
    "Developing the solution was iterative and involved testing different strategies. I explored algorithms that could handle the problem's constraints more elegantly, such as utilizing arrays to identify missing numbers for faster processes.\n",

    "Reviewing my partner's assignment were invaluable, and being familiar with his process and solution helped me gain new perspectives on solving problems related to binary trees. It was informative to see how my partner Eliezer could tackle the problem, underscoring the diversity of problem-solving in programming. This peer review enhanced my ability to evaluate a solution critically.\n",
